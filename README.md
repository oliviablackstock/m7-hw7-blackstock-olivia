# Week 7 Homework 

## Stumbling Blocks
The tooltip section was a little intense but following the resources from this week's readings made it easy to walk through. I appreciated your tip in the video you recorded going over week 6's homework about the z-index as I would have struggled to figure that portion out. Otherwise, I found this week's assignment straightforward and relatively simple to implement.
